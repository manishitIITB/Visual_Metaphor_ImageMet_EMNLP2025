Chain-of-Thought Guide - Think step-by-step:

Step 1: Image and Task Context

You are given an image that may contain a visual metaphor. You are also given a scene graph of that image. Your task is
to analyze the image in a structured manner to progressively uncover its metaphorical meaning.



Step 2: Objective Understanding (Basic Image Comprehension)

First, extract factual information about the image.
    a. Identify all objects present in the image. List them clearly.
    b. Describe the attributes (e.g., color, size, texture) of the objects.
    c. Explain the spatial arrangement of the objects.
    d. Identify any interactions between the objects. If applicable, describe them.
    e. Determine if any humans or animals are present. If yes, describe their actions.
    f. Extract any visible text from the image and transcribe it.



Step 3: Visual Metaphor Building Block Understanding (Contextual Interpretation)

A visual metaphor contains a source domain and a target domain. The target domain is usually present in the picture.
The source domain may or may not be visually present. But it will always be visually represented.
The source domain lends one of its qualities to the target domain.
The source domain is often something general that people are familiar with and is used to highlight the quality of the
target domain which is more specialised.
If the source domain is visually present, it may be juxtaposed along with the target. It may also be fused with the target.
If the source domain is visually not present but represented through its perceptual features, it may be through colour,
texture, shape etc. that is commonly and generally associated to the source.

Based on this theoretical understanding of visual metaphors, answer the following questions:
    a. What could be the source? Just write the source. Do not write what it represents.
    b. What could be the target? Just write the target. Do not write what it represents.
    c. What is the quality, attribute or property that the source is lending to the target?

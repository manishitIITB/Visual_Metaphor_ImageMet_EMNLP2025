Your task is to generate a visual elaboration given a simile in 'A is as B as C' format. The key idea in this elaboration is to create a visual scene using C and then swap C with A since A is being compared to C.

CoT Guide - Think step-by-step:

    1. The tenor (A) is the object that is being compared in the simile. What is the tenor?
    2. The vehicle (C) is the object that the tenor is being compared to. What is the vehicle?
    3. The attribute (B) is a property of the vehicle being used to highlight the same property (B) in the tenor. What is the attribute?
    4. Consider this definition of abstract and concrete. Abstract: Concepts that do not have a definite physical form that can be represented visually Concrete: Concepts that have a definite physical form that can be represented visually
    5. Is the tenor abstract or concrete?
    6. Is the vehicle abstract or concrete?

Based on the tenor and vehicle type, determine which of the following cases applies, and follow the corresponding rules.
Only one case applies per sentence.

CASE 1: If the tenor is concrete and the vehicle is concrete: You must adhere to the following rules:
    Rule-1: Create a visual elaboration with the vehicle as the focus of the scene.
    Rule-2: Replace the vehicle with the tenor in the visual elaboration. You should swap exactly the vehicle with the
    tenor without changing any other component of the visual elaboration. Do not mention the vehicle in this rewritten elaboration.
    Rule-3: Write the same visual elaboration concisely within 40 words.

CASE 2: If the tenor is concrete and the vehicle is abstract: You must adhere to the following rules:
    Rule-1: Think of a way to visually represent the vehicle using a concrete concept.
    Rule-2: Create a visual elaboration with this concrete concept as the focus of the scene.
    Rule-3: Replace the concrete concept with the tenor in the visual elaboration. Also include the concrete concept in the visual elaboration. Create a juxtaposition or fusion of the tenor and the concrete concept.
    Rule-4: Write the same visual elaboration concisely within 40 words.

CASE 3: If the tenor is abstract and the vehicle is concrete: You must adhere to the following rules:
    Rule-1: Create a visual elaboration with the vehicle as the focus of the scene.
    Rule-2: Think of a way to visually represent the tenor using a concrete concept, a scene or some objects.
    Rule-3: Introduce the tenor’s visual representation in the visual elaboration and make it the focus of the scene. Create a juxtaposition or fusion of the vehicle and the tenor’s visual representation.
    Rule-4: Write the same visual elaboration concisely within 40 words.

CASE 4: If the tenor is abstract and the vehicle is abstract: You must adhere to the following rules:
    Rule-1: Think of a way to visually represent the vehicle using a concrete concept, a scene or some objects.
    Rule-2: Think of a way to visually represent the tenor using a concrete concept, a scene or some objects.
    Rule-3: Create a visual elaboration, making a meaningful juxtaposition or fusion of the tenor and the vehicle’s visual representations.
    Rule-4: Write the same visual elaboration concisely within 40 words.
